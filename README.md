# DECYPHER README

## [Wiki Design Documents](https://github.com/ibltsandwich/decypher/wiki)

## Description
Decypher allows users to upload and annotate song lyrics.


## Technologies Used
Ruby on Rails backend with React-Redux frontend.

Javascript's built-in getSelection API was used for annotations.
Unforunately, the API had some shortcomings and some workarounds had to be implemented in order to get annotations working semi-properly.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
