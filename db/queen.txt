Formed in 1970, Queen was a British rock band whose classic line-up consisted of Freddie Mercury on lead vocals, Brian May on lead guitar, Roger Taylor on drums, and John Deacon on bass. Although Mercury and May wrote the bulk of the band’s songs, all four contributed to the songwriting and wrote huge hits.

Initially a progressive rock band with strong metal influences, their sound evolved dramatically over time, and they became one of the biggest stadium rock bands of all time.

Their early progressive phase spawned epic tracks like “March of the Black Queen” and “The Prophet’s Song”, but it was “Bohemian Rhapsody” which catapulted them to fame. The song remained at #1 for nine weeks, and is widely considered one of the greatest songs ever written in addition to being the band’s greatest hit.

After moving away from their album-orientated sound, the band would go on to record many more hits such as “Don’t Stop Me Now”, “Another One Bites the Dust”, “I Want to Break Free”, “Radio Ga Ga”, “We Are the Champions”, and “Under Pressure”. These songs are so loved that We Will Rock You, a musical based on the band’s songs, ran for an unprecedented 12 years at the Dominion Theatre in London.

Freddie Mercury died due to complications related to AIDS in 1991, just months after the release of Queen’s 14th studio album Innuendo, which was widely regarded as their best album in 15 years. While John Deacon subsequently retired from public life, May and Taylor still tour as Queen, with stand-in lead vocalists such as Adam Lambert and Paul Rogers.
