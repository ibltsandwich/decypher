[Intro]
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

[Verse 1]
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry) Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (somebody)
Ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

[Verse 2]
I work hard (he works hard)
Every day of my life
I work til' I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own (goes home on his own)
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
Til' the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (somebody)
Ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

[Bridge]
(He works hard)
Everyday (everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
No, I got no common sense
(He's got) Got nobody left to believe
No, no, no, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
(Oh Lord)
Ooh somebody
Ooh (somebody)
Anybody find me
Somebody to love
(Anybody find me someone to love)

[Verse 3]
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

[Outro]
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

Somebody (somebody)
Somebody (somebody)
Somebody (find me)
(Somebody find me somebody to love)
Can (anybody find me)
Somebody to love?
(Find me somebody to love) Ooh
(Find me somebody to love) Every somebody
(Find me somebody to love) Somebody, somebody, somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love) Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love) Ooh
(Find me somebody to love) Somebody find me, find me somebody to love
(Find me somebody to love) Anybody, anywhere, anybody find me somebody to love
Find me, find me, find me
